# Generative AI in Orthopedics: An Explainable Deep Few-Shot Image Augmentation Pipeline for Plain Knee Radiographs and Kellgren–Lawrence Grading

This GitHub repository includes all Python codes and implementations to train, generate, and validate synthetic knee radiographs using a few-shot learning pipeline, along with code to train the downstream task of Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) grade classification using only the synthetic radiographs.  

### Osteoarthritis Initiative
The entire dataset (00m/96m) analyzed during the current study is publicly available at the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). You can apply for access here: https://nda.nih.gov/oai. 

### Complete Synthetic Dataset
